famous algorithms implementations for playing with <br/>

The algorithms contained here were (originally) the result of a workshop held in Mexico city during December of 2015. So, please be carefully because they could be a bit spicy.<br/>
As generative systems used algorithms for its different functionalities, I was interested in make those processes obvious in order to be able to reflect on the processes and possibilities they open form a creative perspective. For that purpose, we started by working with some on the most famous algorithms (bubble sort and insertion sort, for example). Then, we copied, modified, and wrote code, until we had the desired result.
The algorithms were designed to produce outputs containing the different steps of the process. For example, the bubble sort algorithm gives an array of arrays containing each iteration over the input array in the sorting process. Most of the implementations are written in supercollider, but we did not interested in the language but in the idea and the processes.<br/>
